Born in Grenoble, France, in 1972, Bellard demonstrated a passion for electronics and programming from a young age, starting with a TI-59 scientific calculator and later a TI-99/4A home computer.\n\n**Early Programming and Key Contributions:**\n\n*   **LZEXE:** At age fifteen, Bellard created LZEXE, a pioneering executable file compression method for personal computers, inspired by LZSS. This showcased his early proficiency in low-level coding.\n*   **Education at École Polytechnique:** He attended the prestigious École Polytechnique, a French military academy specializing in engineering, which he found liberating due to its focus on breadth and extensive resources.\n*   **Pollard’s FFT Implementation:** In 1995, he implemented Pollard’s FFT fast multiplication method in C, enabling the calculation of millions of digits of π.\n*   **Binary Digit Calculation of π:** In 1997, he significantly improved the algorithm for calculating binary digits of π, achieving a 43% speed increase.\n*   **TinyGL:** In 2002, Bellard developed TinyGL, an exceptionally small and fast implementation of a subset of OpenGL.\n*   **FFmpeg:** Starting in 2000, he created FFmpeg, a versatile multimedia framework for recording, streaming, and converting various audio and video formats. This project, built on libavcodec and libavformat, has become a cornerstone of digital media processing.\n*   **TinyCC:**  He won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice, leading to the creation of TinyCC, a remarkably small ANSI C99 compiler.\n*   **QEMU:** In 2005, he released QEMU, a processor emulator that uses dynamic translation to achieve near-native performance. This has become vital in virtualization technologies.\n\n**Bellard's Philosophy and Advice:**\n\nBellard believes computer science should encompass both practical application and theoretical understanding. He emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation in computer hardware and low-level programming. He prioritizes open-source development, releasing his projects freely to benefit the wider community, driven by his passion for interesting and useful projects rather than financial gain.  He encourages future computer scientists to study the fundamentals and gain a deep understanding of how computers work.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\nThe article highlights Bellard’s exceptional programming skills, his ability to innovate across diverse areas of computer science, and his commitment to open-source principles.  His work demonstrates a deep understanding of both hardware and software, combined with an aptitude for mathematical innovation."},{"time":1766621412,"type":"story","descendants":52,"title":"Who Watches the Waymos?
