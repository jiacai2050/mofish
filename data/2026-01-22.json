You can download the weights here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;sweepai&#x2F;sweep-next-edit-1.5b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;sweepai&#x2F;sweep-next-edit-1.5b</a>) or try it in our JetBrains plugin (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plugins.jetbrains.com&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;26860-sweep-ai-autocomplete--coding-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plugins.jetbrains.com&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;26860-sweep-ai-autocomp...</a>).<p>Next-edit autocomplete differs from standard autocomplete by using your recent edits as context when predicting completions. The model is small enough to run locally while outperforming models 4x its size on both speed and accuracy.<p>We tested against Mercury (Inception), Zeta (Zed), and Instinct (Continue) across five benchmarks: next-edit above&#x2F;below cursor, tab-to-jump for distant changes, standard FIM, and noisiness. We found exact-match accuracy correlates best with real usability because code is fairly precise and the solution space is small.<p>Prompt format turned out to matter more than we expected. We ran a genetic algorithm over 30+ diff formats and found simple `original`&#x2F;`updated` blocks beat unified diffs. The verbose format is just easier for smaller models to understand.<p>Training was SFT on ~100k examples from permissively-licensed repos (4hrs on 8xH100), then RL for 2000 steps with tree-sitter parse checking and size regularization. The RL step fixes edge cases SFT can’t like, generating code that doesn’t parse or overly verbose outputs.<p>We&#x27;re open-sourcing the weights so the community can build fast, privacy-preserving autocomplete for any editor. If you&#x27;re building for VSCode, Neovim, or something else, we&#x27;d love to see what you make with it!","summary":"## Sweep Next-Edit 代码补全模型总结\n\n该模型是一个1.5B参数的下一编辑补全模型，已量化为Q8_0 GGUF格式。\n\n**主要特点：**\n\n*   **功能描述:** Sweep Next-Edit旨在预测开发者接下来要做的代码编辑。\n*   **性能:** 模型可以在笔记本电脑上本地运行，延迟小于500ms（使用投机解码），并在下一编辑基准测试中优于其四倍大小的模型。\n*   **使用方法:**\n    *   下载 `run_model.py` 和模型文件。\n    *   使用 `pip install llama-cpp-python huggingface_hub` 安装依赖。\n    *   运行 `python run_model.py` 启动模型。\n*   **模型细节:**\n    *   **格式:** GGUF (Q8\\_0 量化)\n    *   **参数量:** 1.5B\n    *   **上下文长度:** 8192 tokens\n    *   **基础模型:** Qwen2.5-Coder\n*   **提示格式:** 模型使用特定的提示格式，包含文件上下文、最近的diff以及当前状态，用于预测下一个编辑。 具体示例请参考 `run_model.py`。\n\n**相关链接:**\n\n*   [Blog Post](https://blog.sweep.dev/posts/oss-next-edit): 技术细节和基准测试\n*   [JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26860-sweep-ai-autocomplete--coding-agent): Sweep AI JetBrains 插件\n*   [HN Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46713106): 讨论在 VSCode、Neovim 和 Emacs 中的实现\n*   [Twitter Post](https://x.com/sweepai/status/2014045512417345883): 提问\n\n**许可证:** Apache 2.0\n"},{"time":1769012079,"type":"story","descendants":340,"title":"Tell HN: Bending Spoons laid off almost everybody at Vimeo yesterday","id":46707699,"score":355,"by":"Daemon404","text":"As expected.
